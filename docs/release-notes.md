## May, 14th, 2025: New distilled model 13B v0.9.7:
- Release a new 13B distilled model [ltxv-13b-0.9.7-distilled](https://huggingface.co/Lightricks/LTX-Video/blob/main/ltxv-13b-0.9.7-distilled.safetensors)
    * Amazing for iterative work - generates HD videos in 10 seconds, with low-res preview after just 3 seconds (on H100)!
    * Does not require classifier-free guidance and spatio-temporal guidance.
    * Supports sampling with 8 (recommended), or less diffusion steps.
    * Also released a LoRA version of the distilled model, [ltxv-13b-0.9.7-distilled-lora128](https://huggingface.co/Lightricks/LTX-Video/blob/main/ltxv-13b-0.9.7-distilled-lora128.safetensors)
        * Requires only 1GB of VRAM
        * Can be used with the full 13B model for fast inference
- Release a new quantized distilled model [ltxv-13b-0.9.7-distilled-fp8](https://huggingface.co/Lightricks/LTX-Video/blob/main/ltxv-13b-0.9.7-distilled-fp8.safetensors) for *real-time* generation (on H100) with even less VRAM

## May, 5th, 2025: New model 13B v0.9.7:
- Release a new 13B model [ltxv-13b-0.9.7-dev](https://huggingface.co/Lightricks/LTX-Video/blob/main/ltxv-13b-0.9.7-dev.safetensors)
- Release a new quantized model [ltxv-13b-0.9.7-dev-fp8](https://huggingface.co/Lightricks/LTX-Video/blob/main/ltxv-13b-0.9.7-dev-fp8.safetensors) for faster inference with less VRam
- Release a new upscalers
  * [ltxv-temporal-upscaler-0.9.7](https://huggingface.co/Lightricks/LTX-Video/blob/main/ltxv-temporal-upscaler-0.9.7.safetensors)
  * [ltxv-spatial-upscaler-0.9.7](https://huggingface.co/Lightricks/LTX-Video/blob/main/ltxv-spatial-upscaler-0.9.7.safetensors)
- Breakthrough prompt adherence and physical understanding.
- New Pipeline for multi-scale video rendering for fast and high quality results


## April, 15th, 2025: New checkpoints v0.9.6:
- Release a new checkpoint [ltxv-2b-0.9.6-dev-04-25](https://huggingface.co/Lightricks/LTX-Video/blob/main/ltxv-2b-0.9.6-dev-04-25.safetensors) with improved quality
- Release a new distilled model [ltxv-2b-0.9.6-distilled-04-25](https://huggingface.co/Lightricks/LTX-Video/blob/main/ltxv-2b-0.9.6-distilled-04-25.safetensors)
    * 15x faster inference than non-distilled model.
    * Does not require classifier-free guidance and spatio-temporal guidance.
    * Supports sampling with 8 (recommended), or less diffusion steps.
- Improved prompt adherence, motion quality and fine details.
- New default resolution and FPS: 1216 Ã— 704 pixels at 30 FPS
    * Still real time on H100 with the distilled model.
    * Other resolutions and FPS are still supported.
- Support stochastic inference (can improve visual quality when using the distilled model)
